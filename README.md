# Zero Order Optimization Techniques for Robotics


This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the experiment of the paper: "An Introduction to Zero-Order Optimization Techniques for Robotics". The project is divided in two main sections:
- The `traj_opt` folder contains the trajectory optimization results.
- The `rl` folder contains the reinforcement learning results.
